    <h1>End User License Agreement</h1>
    <p>Last updated: May 2, 2024</p>
    <p>Please read this End User License Agreement ("EULA") carefully before using the Aqueous mobile application (the "Application") operated by Aqueous ("us," "we," or "our").</p>
    <p>By downloading or using the Application, you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this EULA. If you do not agree with the terms, you are not authorized to use the Application.</p>

    <h2>Scope of License</h2>
    <p>This EULA grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the Application on your Apple-branded devices. You may not distribute or make the Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You are not allowed to transfer, redistribute, or sublicense the Application, and if you sell your device, you must remove the Application from it before doing so. You may not copy, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Application or any updates, except as permitted by law or the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Application.</p>

    <h2>Consent to Use of Data</h2>
    <p>You agree that Aqueous may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system, and software—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you related to the Application. This data will not be used in a form that personally identifies you without obtaining your prior consent.</p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>This EULA is effective until terminated by you or us. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from us if you fail to comply with any of its terms. Upon termination of the license, you shall cease all use of the Application and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Application.</p>

    <h2>Services and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>The Application may enable access to Aqueous's and/or third-party services and websites. Use of these services may require Internet access and that you accept additional terms of service.</p>

    <h2>No Warranty</h2>
    <p>You expressly acknowledge and agree that use of the Application is at your sole risk. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, the Application and any services performed or provided by the Application are provided "as is" and “as available,” with all faults and without warranty of any kind, and Aqueous hereby disclaims all warranties and conditions with respect to the Application and any services, either express, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, of fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.</p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event shall Aqueous be liable for personal injury, or any incidental, special, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever, including, without limitation, damages for loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption or any other commercial damages or losses, arising out of or related to your use or inability to use the Application, however caused, regardless of the theory of liability (contract, tort, or otherwise) and even if Aqueous has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation of liability for personal injury, or of incidental or consequential damages, so this limitation may not apply to you.</p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>This EULA and your use of the Application will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which Aqueous is located, excluding its conflicts of law rules.</p>

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions regarding this EULA, contact us at <a href="mailto:helpaqofficial@gmail.com">helpaqofficial@gmail.com</a>.</p>
